## Create a connection and listen for events
Creating a connection is pretty easy but will also be improved in the future. But for now just do it like this:
```csharp
using (var client = KrakenApi.ClientFactory.Create("wss://ws-sandbox.kraken.com")) 
{
    client.SystemStatusChanged += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"System status changed");
    client.SubscriptionStatusChanged += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Subscription status changed"); ;
    client.TickerReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Ticker received");
    client.OhlcReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Ohlc received");
    client.TradeReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Trade received");
    client.SpreadReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Spread received");
    client.BookSnapshotReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"BookSnapshot received");
    client.BookUpdateReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine($"BookUpdate received");
    
    await kraken.ConnectAsync();
    // Do something with it and keep the connection open
}
// closing the using-block the connection will be closed and disposed.
```
You can also find a running example in the repository.
